In this repository there are following folders:

1. Automation Script (From Microsoft Sharepoint to Pandas DataFrame) - this script connects to Microsoft SharePoint excel file via. "device access" or "user access" (without 2 step authentication) and converts the data to Pandas DataFrame for futher manipulations.

2. Energy Consumption - attempts of using different time series models for energy consumption data. 

3. Report Automation Script (From Microsoft SQL to Excel with data cleaning) - this script was created as a part of "automation" process for our clients reports. It takas data from Microsoft SQL Studio and converts it to Pandas DataFrame object, cleans it and saves the final output as an excel file.

4. Universal cross-validation - attempts to write a "unique" cross validation code, which could be used for idfferent ways of data pre-processing, feature selection and model selection.

5. Web Scrapping Script for tables from web - script for scrapping several pages with authentication. 

6. Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset - on a given train dataset (consists of data from "sport" bracers) whe have to train a model to classify the sportsmen into 5 categories (A,B,C, etc.) and to test the model on a "test dataset".

7. Wine Quality - on a given dataset we have to predict a quality of wine (categories from 1 to 8). I have used all the possible supervised models such linear regression, all types of classifier models, also unsupervised such as K-Means Clusters including PCA.
